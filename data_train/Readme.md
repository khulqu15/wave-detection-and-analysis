A transfer function, in the context of neural networks, is a function that maps the inputs of a neural network to its outputs. It can be seen as a mathematical representation of the neural network's behavior.

In the code above, the transfer functions are used in the layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN). The Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) transfer function is used in the first three convolutional layers, and the softmax function is used in the last dense layer.

The ReLU function is a simple piecewise linear function that returns the input if it is positive, and 0 if it is negative. Its output is graphed as a straight line with slope 1 for x > 0, and 0 for x <= 0.

The softmax function is a nonlinear function that maps a vector of arbitrary real values to a vector of values between 0 and 1 that sum up to 1. Its output can be graphed as a curve that starts at 0, increases gradually, and then sharply rises to 1 as the input values become large.

The output of the neural network is a probability distribution over the two classes, waves and not_waves, represented by a vector of two values between 0 and 1 that sum up to 1. The softmax function ensures that the output vector is a valid probability distribution. The predicted class is the class with the highest probability value.
