# wave-detection-and-analysis
Detecting waves in a video and analyzing the wave run-up height, as well as classifying the wave data at the coastal end to measure the wave reach. The code utilizes optical flow and deep learning algorithms to provide accurate results. The project is useful for coastal engineering research, environmental monitoring, and coastal management.
